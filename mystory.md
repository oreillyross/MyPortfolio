I began programming in the early 1990s. I started with Amiga BASIC and then formally studied computer science completing a one year diploma course in 
computer studies where I learnt all about the basics of computers, (hardware, memory, systems design etc.). I also learnt to code in COBOL and I 
finished my course being introduced to Turbo Pascal.

I went on to work for a medical applications company called Orion, now called Health Focus as a software support technician. Later in early 2000 I worked 
for a software development company called Real Systems, now called Khanyisa Real Systems. I worked mainly in Delphi, and a few months before I left 
I coded in Java working on a form making app using an xml configuration file and SOAP.

I left the industry around 2003, and left my homeland, South Africa and worked in the emergency medical field, and later in the security management field up to 2021. 
In 2013 I picked up orgramming again, mainly as a hobby and something to do in the evenings. I wanted to get back into the field of software development but wasn't
quite sure where to start or what to specialise in. I took countless courses online ranging from Haskell, Scala, Microservices, Java, Javascript, Typescript courses 
to name a few and landed on the following combination where I continue to finesse my skills: HTML5, CSS, ES6+, Typescript, and GraphQL. I am continually learning 
and am now focused on learning Docker, and the Serverless landscape.
