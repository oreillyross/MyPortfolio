I get by just fine using a Windows 10 laptop running WSL2 (ubuntu distro).
 
I code mostly in VS Code and am trying my hand at using the VIM mode. I adhere to the strict linting practices, using ESLint, and Prettier installed globally for auto-formatting the code with the auto format on save option to save time and energy.

I enjoy using traditional SQL databases, such as postgres SQL, but I am equally comfortable using document databases, such as MongoDB. I have yet to properly explore KV stores.

I try to not use starter kits, except for the basic starter kit of whichever framework or library I am using. NextJS, Gatsby, and React (create-react-app) all have pretty sensible defaults and saves me heaps of time in setting up the Typescript/Babel, ESLint, Webpack, Dev Server, Jest Testing pipeline and configuration.
