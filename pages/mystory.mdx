  <h3>My story</h3>
</div>

I began programming in the early _1990s_. <br/><br/>

I started with Amiga BASIC and then formally studied computer science
completing a one year diploma course in computer studies 
where I learnt all about the basics of computers, 
(hardware, memory, systems design etc.). I also learnt 
to code in COBOL and I finished my course being 
introduced to Turbo Pascal. <br/><br/> 

I went on to work for a medical applications company 
called Orion, now called Health Focus as a software 
support technician. Later in early 2000 I worked for a 
software development company called Real Systems, now 
called Khanyisa Real Systems. I worked mainly in Delphi, 
and a few months before I left I coded in Java working 
on a form making app using an xml configuration file 
and SOAP.<br/><br/> 

I left the industry around 2003, and left my homeland, 
South Africa and worked in the emergency medical field, 
and later in the security management field up to 2021. 
<br/><br/>
In 2013 I picked up programming again, mainly as a hobby 
and something to do in the evenings. I wanted to get 
back into the field of software development but wasn't 
quite sure where to start or what to specialise in. I 
took countless courses online ranging from Haskell, 
Scala, Microservices, Java, Javascript, Typescript
courses to name a few and landed on the following 
combination where I continue to finesse my skills:
HTML5, CSS, ES6+, Typescript, and GraphQL. <br/><br/>
I am continually learning and am now focused on learning
Docker, and the Serverless landscape. 
<br/><br/>
Following the COVID pandemic, I like many thousands 
of others reflected on their lives and I decided 
that I wanted to work full time in the field of 
software development again to be able to take advantage 
of the more fulfilling life as a coder, with freedom to 
work remotely, and freedom to be creative.
