Ross O'Reilly — Founder, Faktor_10
I’m Ross, founder of Faktor_10, where we believe the fastest way to build great products is to build fast, learn fast, and iterate relentlessly.

My workflow is simple but non-negotiable: ship quickly, validate ruthlessly, and refine with purpose. Every project at Faktor_10 runs through these tight learning loops—because polished products people are happy to pay for don’t come from overthinking; they come from real-world feedback and rapid iteration.

Before Faktor_10, I obsessed over my own daily problems. Take food waste—I built a pantry app that scans ingredients, tracks expiry dates, and suggests recipes based on what’s about to go bad. It’s practical. It’s lean. And it reflects how I think: solve real problems with simple, elegant systems.

I thrive solo, deep in the flow state, but I design systems that scale beyond myself. My current frontier is agentic AI—building smart assistants that think and act on behalf of users, turning complex workflows into smooth, autonomous experiences.

At Faktor_10, we’re not chasing vanity metrics. We chase validated learning, crafting products that are useful on day one, and indispensable after ten iterations.

If you believe in building fast, functional, and fearless, we’ll get along.
