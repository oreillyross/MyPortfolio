I am proficcient in coding in Typescript, Javascript, and Python. My first ever language which I coded in was called Amiga BASIC around 1995. I formally studied COBOL, and Pascal and worked for for 2 years from 1999 in Borland Delphi, a dominant Object oriented language. Before leaving the softare industry I was coding in Java version 4. 

Much much later I cam back to software development and settled on coding in Typescript, Javascript and Python. I have tried a number of other languages, namely Haskell, Scala, Golang but find a nice balance by using Typescript, and Javascript for front end development work, and some backend nodeJS or Deno work, and using Python for my machine learning projects, and coding up Data Structures and Algorithms used to solve coding challenges.
