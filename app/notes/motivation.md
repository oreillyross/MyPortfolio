When I finished my diploma in computer studies in 1997, I was a Delphi developer. 
Delphi was the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) rage back then, putting a visual IDE on top of Pascal. 

Java was just becoming a thing, but it was slow and awkward to use. I left the industry after 2 years of 
stumbling through Java, XML, and SOAP. The terms Full stack developer, Backend as a service, Heck even Node, npm, 
and even jquery weren't around yet. I went off to see what else the world had to offer and returned around 
2015, to discover the whole landscape had changed and it was amazing. To this day I am amazed at how creative
everybody is with the tooling and how fun the developer experience is. And I see absolutely no signs of this stopping
or slowing down. 

What excites me the most is the ability to write robust, production grade code in a dynamic language like Javascript. The javascript
tooling that exists to support you is phenomenol, you have Typescript, ESLint (and a ton of competitors), insanely fast transpilers and bundlers such as babel, webpack, parcel, snowflake to name a few and then the community which are always ever present.

And I havent even mentioned Deno, Remix run, or the hugely growing Web3 space.

With that all said I am very glad to be back, with a much more mature approach to software development. I respect (and love) learning 
about data structures, algorithms, and programming patterns. For me software development has been redfined for me to mean lifelong learning,
exploration and just having fun in a mentally taxing way. Coding and problem solving is my crossword puzzles, its my therapy.

I am driven to build code that solves problems related to climate change, improving the lives of mankind, and making everyone's 
lives easier. Creating software which takes away menial tasks, decision making and activities to allow everyone to spend more time 
with what matters, spending time with their loved ones, themselves and nature.
