        Describe here your journey to how you got to where you are now, include
        the programming from 1990s, borrowing your uncles Borland C++ manuals,
        then studying in Cobol, and Pascal, and Systems design, your first
        developer job as a Delphi programmer, then being frustrated by the Java
        ability to make reasonable SOAP requests over XML-RPC (Reasearch this a
        bit). At the same time as a volunteer medic and fire fighter, left full
        time ambulance service, moved aborad and migrated into international
        politics and security. 2016 turning point felt a strong desire to own
        more of my space and time, with family. Coding was a sensible route. The
        final push came during covid when it became evident that coding really
        is a way out of the office melodrama. Started with Scala, natural
        evolution from Java, then jumped every year since 2016 to try different
        languages, explored Haskell, Javascript, Typescript, Python, and most
        recently Go. Comfortable using the languages Typescript, Python and
        Golang.

            Constantly searching for enlightenment through deep focus coding and
            learning. Constantly attempting to get into and remain in the bliss
            of the flow state, where time and space appear not to exist.
            Enmeshed in the code, in the system, in the web, building for the
