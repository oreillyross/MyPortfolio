## Here we go
- a list
Since I was 12 years old I have always known computers. My dad bought for the family an Amiga 500 in the early 90s, he used it for graphics work, me and my brother mainly gaming in our 4 bedroom house in Sun Valley, Cape Town. At the time it was pretty state of the art. I began exploring coding in BASIC, and was fortunate enough to borrow the compendium books of Borland C++ from my uncle who was working for IBM at the time. Years later I studied computer science formally, it was a one year intensive course in Systems design, using Cobol and later Pascal. Looking back I realised I had trained in a fairly dated tech stack, but was able to use my Pascal skills in the up and coming OOP language Delphi. It had a great DX in the sense much if it was visual. drag and drop components, which was quite forward thinking in the mid 1990s. I got my first developer job as a developer for a boutique software development agency called Real Systems. They are still running, having changed their name to Khanyisa Real Systems. During my time there I moved from Delphi work to Java. No one was really using it yet in production and I was one of a few toying with it. One of the things we tried to make it do, bear in mind this is Java 1.x., was to build a library which could communicate a front end medical form in XML via SOAP/XML-RPC. Rest APIs only reached us in early 2000s. Out of sheer frustration not able to get this tech to work for me, and a desire to explore my part time work as a medic more, I left and began my second career working as a full time medic for the ambulance service, moving abroad to London, UK then going on to work for an international assistance company, studying political science and working for a number of international organisations in the field of international security and risk management. 

Around 2016 I felt I had achieved what I wanted in the career of international security, and had a desire to reclaim my time and space, and had seen software engineers were increasingly able to work remotely on their own schedule, something that really spoke to me, and currently still does. I began re-exploring software development again, initially just with a mild curiosity, I took a number of MOOC courses, thought I would start with Scala, seemed like a Java friendly language, then every few months as my software development celebrity list increased through twitter, newsletters, and youtube, I explored Javascript, Typescript, Python Rust, Golang, Haskell and converged on what I feel is a comfortable balance between a good DX and access to pleasant mentors and other developers. I currently have a good grasp of React, Javascript, Typescript, Python and I am learning Golang.

I am a self-taught software engineer having taken a one year python course online, offered through ICTTraining.nl, completed a number of courses through FrontEnd Masters, Udemy, and have a lifetime subscription to Neetcode, and Algomonsters. I have also worked through most of Kent C Dodds Epic React course, and Wes Bos Full Stack React course. My subscription to RealPython expires in June 2024, and I have a running subscription to Manning which produce some wonderful MEAPS, my reading list grows every day.
